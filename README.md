## Description

This is a React Native Challenge using: TypeScript, styled-components, Jest and Enzyme. The test told us that the codebase must be handcrafted, without using any boilerplate or third-party library.

- ### You can find a release apk for android in&nbsp;&nbsp;`android apk`&nbsp;&nbsp;folder.
- ### You can find a release .app for ios in&nbsp;&nbsp;`ios app`&nbsp;&nbsp;folder.

## Improvements

   - React Navigation.
   - Axios.
   - Redux or Zustand.
   - And some other library to make our lifes easier ðŸ˜….
